SediFoam is a hybrid CFD--DEM solver for particle-laden flows based on two open-source codes: OpenFOAM, an object-oriented CFD platform by OpenCFD, and LAMMPS, a highly efficient molecular dynamics solver by Sandia National Laboratories. The algorithms used in this solver are published in H.Xiao and J.Sun (2010) and R.Sun and H.Xiao (2014a,b).
