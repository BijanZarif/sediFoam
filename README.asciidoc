SediFoam: A general-purpose, open-source CFD-DEM solver for particle-laden flows
==========================================================
Heng Xiao <hengxiao@vt.edu>



SediFoam is a hybrid CFD--DEM solver for particle-laden flows based on two open-source codes: OpenFOAM, an object-oriented CFD platform by OpenCFD, and LAMMPS, a highly efficient molecular dynamics solver by Sandia National Laboratories. The algorithms used in this solver are published in Xiao and Sun <<Xiao2011>> and R.Sun and H.Xiao <<Sun2015a,Sun2015b>>. A capability demonstration of the solver is published in Sun and Xiao <<Sun2016>>. Other application include sand dune migration <<>>.

Implementation: Rui Sun (2013-present), Heng Xiao (2008-present) +
With contribution from: Jin Sun (2008-2010), Prashant Gupta +
